# Car Dealership with a Database

In this project, the previous car dealership application has been updated to allow direct connectivity to a database. 
Rather than storing any vehicle information, customer information or contract information locally through csv files, the application now reads from and writes to a database using MySQL.

Since the application is pretty similar to its predecessor, I will be glossing over any unmodified menus and menu options and instead focus on new menu additions.

## Home Screen

#### The Home Screen is where users are greeted and prompted to:

- View all vehicles
- Browse vehicles by filter
- Manage vehicles
- Manage Sales and Leases

></details>

## Manage Vehicles

#### If the user chooses 'Manage Vehicles', the user is able to modify the dealership's inventory of vehicles by:

- Adding a vehicle
- Update a vehicle
- Removing a vehicle

><details>
><summary> Manage Vehicles Screen </summary>

></details>

If the user chooses 'Update a vehicle', they are first prompted to enter in the VIN of the vehicle they would like to update.
Afterwards, the user is shown a list which they are able to select from to update the vehicle based on the VIN they entered earlier.

## Manage Sales and Leases

#### If the user chooses 'Manage Sales and Leases', they are prompted to choose to access the dealership's sales contracts or lease contracts.

#### Afterwards, the user will be able to:

- View all sales or lease contracts
- Search for a specific sales or lease contract
- Create a new sales or lease contract
- Update an existing sales or lease contract
- Remove a sales or lease contract
